						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p class="Raleway">Pranav Jain is currently a Junior at Pennsylvania State University, completing his undergrad B.S in Computer Science. He has over 7 years of experience working in the industry and has worked in a variety of unique parts of the tech industry. He has experience in iOS/Android Development, network security standards & procedures, no-SQL databases, and Low-Energy Bluetooth technology. His other areas of expertise include business analysis/strategy, product development, project management, and wire-framing. He also has experience in a wide variety of industries including: financial services, education, and mobile application development.</p>
						<p class="Raleway">He started his work in 2012 at a startup called LearningJar. Based out of San Francisco, LearningJar built coursework from aggregated materials online and accredited users who passed their lessons. There, he worked on personas and user interfaces. Afterwards, he moved on to work at a financial firm, Mehta and Associates. There he build an application to interface with cloud services and ensure that private client information was securely stored in an effective manner online.
						</p>
						<p class="Raleway">
							Afterwards he moved onto more advanced ventures. He worked at a mobile development firm, where he was tasked with developing an iBeacon platform for their overarching platform for mobile development. Using Low Energy Bluetooth, he programmed multiple iOS and Windows packages to act as libraries for future developers to build technologies on top of.
						</p>
						<p class="Raleway">
							Since then, he has always been working on cutting edge technology; like when the Hyperloop concept first came out. Rather than wait, he went out into the multitude of forums online to pitch in. After a while, Dirk Ahlborn, CEO of Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, reached out to him about joining them officially to continue my work. 3 years later, I have helped design their ticketing and mobile solutions as well as parts of their hyperloop pod. 
						</p>
						<p class="Raleway">
							While he loves working at different companies, he also loves to spend time working on different projects, messing around with code, and building tools for my peers and himself. Hackathons provided him an outlet for that, as well as to test his capability and creativity in solving problems. It was at one of these hackathons that led him to start his first company.
						</p>
						<p class="Raleway">
							At HackPSU Fall 2015, he had won Penn State Launchbox’s Invent Penn State Challenge. Thanks to the prizes of the challenge, he got connections with many investors and faculty associated with Invent Penn State, most notably his mentor, Kevin Harter. After being introduced to him, he joined the Entrepreneurship club which he advised, and started planning my first company.
						</p>
						<p class="Raleway">
							A little over 1 year later, he went to HackPSU Fall 2016, where he built Nuntagri, a chatbot to revolutionize food logistics around the world. He presented his idea and won a trip to Amsterdam for the Thought for Food Global Summit last summer to present his idea in front of numerous innovators and leaders of global food markets to find a way to feed 9 billion people by the year 2050.
						</p>
						<p class="Raleway">
							He is now working on expanding NuntAgri’s operations to multiple clients and scaling it up to bring affordable logistics services to people across the world.
